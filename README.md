# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview and Purpose
This analysis examined data collected by PyBer, a Python based ride-sharing app to determine how ride-sharing data differs between city type. Two different data sets were merged to create a dataframe that contained all the necessary information. The summary of the data obtained will be submiitted to decision-makers at Pyber to enhance the service. 

## Results
A summary dataframe was generated which shows that rural locations have the lowest total fares but the highest average fares per ride and per driver. Urban areas on the other hand have the highest total faires and the lowest average fares per ride adn per driver.

A line graph for the showing the total fare over the first four months of the year by city type was generated. The graph shows that the total fare generated  by urban areas was consistently higher than suburban and rural areas.

## Summary
There are a few recommendations for the CEO to consider in potentially increase revenue:
1. Extend the length of the study to look at the entire year to get a more accurate report of yearly rideshare users.
2. Start making small increases or decreases in fare based on how many riders are expected to be in each city type based on month of the year. 
3. Decrease the number of drivers in urban areas while increasing the number of drivers in rural areas since there are far more drivers than rides in the urban areas and less drivers than rides in rural areas. This will hopefully allow for more drivers to be available in rural areas whereas fewer drivers in the urban areas will lower labour cost since there is an excessive number of drivers in these cities.
